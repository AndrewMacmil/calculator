Calculator Project
A simple, web-based calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the basics of web development by creating an interactive calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations.

Project Structure
HTML (index.html): Provides the structure of the calculator interface.
CSS (chill.css): Adds styling to make the calculator visually appealing.
JavaScript (script.js): Contains the logic for handling calculator inputs, clearing the display, and calculating the result.

Features
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division: Supports basic arithmetic operations.
Clear Display: Ability to reset the calculator display.
Error Handling: Shows an error message if an invalid expression is entered.
Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes.

Setup
Clone the repository or download the files.
Open index.html in your web browser.

Files
index.html: The main HTML file containing the calculator layout.
chill.css: The CSS file for styling the calculator.
script.js: The JavaScript file handling the calculator's functionality.

Usage
Click on the numeric buttons (0-9) and operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to build an arithmetic expression.
Click = to calculate and display the result.
Click C to clear the display.
Code Overview

HTML
The HTML file defines the calculator structure:

display: A readonly input field to show entered numbers and results.
keys: Buttons for numbers, operators, and functions.
CSS
The CSS styles the calculator:

Background colors, button colors, and responsive layout.
chill.css defines different colors for numeric buttons, operators, and the clear button.
JavaScript
The JavaScript file script.js contains three main functions:

appendToDisplay(input): Adds a number or operator to the display.
clearDisplay(): Clears the calculator display.
calculate(): Evaluates the expression in the display and shows the result. Displays an error message if the input is invalid.

Example Usage:
To calculate 7 + 3:
Press 7, +, 3, and =.
The display will show 10.
To clear the display, press C.

PERSONAL OPINION: It is a nice reminder that even simple thing as a calculator can teach you so much.
